# Third-party notices

MLXL3 is an independent implementation that adapts algorithms and kernel
structures from the following projects.

## MTPLX

Source: <https://github.com/youssofal/MTPLX>, revision
`9882703f3105363ddc37eca9f97aa09a1d387112`, Apache-2.0
(`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`). Qwen MTP pre-normalization residual feedback,
device-side recursive drafting, accepted-history KV repair and warm candidate
tuning informed the independent Rust implementation. EXL3 target kernels and
exact greedy verification remain MLXL3 implementations. Upstream performance
numbers are not MLXL3 measurements.

The optional full-vocabulary affine4 draft projection and output-chunked
conversion in `scripts/experimental-draft-head.py` are independently implemented,
informed by `mtplx/draft_lm_head.py`. EXL3 reconstruction/rotations are MLXL3's
implementation; no upstream timing is treated as a local result.

The optional `native/shaders/mtp_add_rms.metal` prototype adapts
`mtplx/kernels/fused_norm.py` at that revision, preserving the rounded
residual and MLX RMSNorm reduction order. Copyright 2026 Youssof Altoukhi,
Apache-2.0. Its 5120-wide variant keeps both groups of lane values in
registers; eligibility is limited to FP16 Qwen MTP rows1..4. The app's
Settings displays "Powered by MTPLX" with the source link.

`native/src/router.rs` adapts the two-stage SIMD row-owned top-8 structure
from `mtplx/qwen_row_owned_router.py` to FP16 monotone keys, legacy tie order
and half accumulation. Copyright MTPLX contributors; Apache-2.0. The small
EXL3 verify batching uses MLXL3's own trellis kernels and arithmetic.

## TensorFold

Source: <https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold>, revision
`cb2ebf0540f42604e2759b2ddef497861e928248`, Apache-2.0
(`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`). Its draft-only vocabulary pruning and grouped target-layer submission
informed independent Q4 row selection, native token-ID remapping and MLX
graph submission. The public
`src/tensorfold/families/qwen4_exp/cuda/draft_vocab.txt` list was used for local
measurements; neither that list nor upstream implementation code is bundled.
The target retains its full vocabulary and exact verification.

## Sushi

Source: <https://github.com/beamivalice/sushi>, revision
`cac6a1ed9284bcd13609eaf80ceed74e0db6cea3`, MIT (`LICENSE` at that revision).
The bounded prompt-lookup and cross-line matching concepts informed an
independent Rust implementation. Proposals still use MLXL3's exact target
verification and accepted-history KV repair. No Sushi code or kernel is bundled;
upstream throughput is not an MLXL3 measurement.

## IncoAI Splash

Source: <https://github.com/inco-ai/splash>.

MLXL3 reads Splash's public DFlash 2 draft package ABI and uses its published
geometry as a compatibility reference. Runtime kernels remain independently
benchmarked MLXL3 implementations and may differ from Splash. Splash is
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; a copy is provided in
`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.

## ExLlamaV3

Source: <https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3>, pinned during development
at `ca5270c4b842876ddbe9a28594fbb6eac516cdf2`.

The EXL3 serialized format, trellis codec, procedural codebooks, permutation,
Hadamard reconstruction, and CUDA kernel algorithms are derived from
ExLlamaV3.

## PonyExl3

Source: <https://github.com/beamivalice/PonyExl3>, pinned during development at
`8e7fa6b1556f59fc669e25087903b279b9b0346f`.

Copyright 2026 Theinruj Toranavikrai

The native Metal QMV/QMM shaders incorporate modified and independently
integrated kernel structures from PonyExl3. MLXL3 changes the
dispatch API, compile-time specialization, permutation embedding, split-K
policy, row crossover, output layout, and integration/tests. PonyExl3 is
licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; a copy is provided in
`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.

The optional converter in `src/mlxl3_quantizer/metal.py` also adapts PonyExl3's Metal
trellis-search source. MLXL3 modifies predecessor sharing, exact codebook
lookups, backpointer storage, search ordering, synchronization and scratch
batching. The bounded allocator-cache modification is distributed separately
in `scripts/patches/ponyexl3-bounded-conversion-cache.patch` under the same
Apache-2.0 terms. These conversion helpers are not used by inference.

## MLX Swift LM

Source: <https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm>, pinned during development
at `5694a2f6705f7c8b9cf195f29ec6d05938d42d22`.

The stable single-row MoE router top-k algorithm in the native Metal runtime is
an adaptation of MLX Swift LM's `MoERouterTopK.swift`. MLXL3 adds its
own runtime dispatch and EXL3 integration. MLX Swift LM is licensed under the
MIT License.

## MLX and MLX LM

Sources: <https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx>, version 0.32.2, and
<https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm>, version 0.32.0.

The packed Gated DeltaNet Metal kernel in
`native/shaders/gated_delta_packed.metal` is carried from MLX LM for exact
behavior during the native Rust migration. MLX LM is licensed under the MIT
License. The dense verification gate in `native/src/lfm2.rs` reproduces MLX's
GEMV reduction geometry so multi-row verification remains bit-exact; MLX is
also licensed under the MIT License.
